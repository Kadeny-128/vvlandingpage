                <p>
                  I&rsquo;m 18, based in Vancouver, and finishing high school before heading to
                  Queen&rsquo;s University for engineering in the fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I got into this space through TKS, a program for young people working on
                  high-impact problems, and an internship at Singularity Health, an AI healthcare
                  startup. Most of what I know about building I learned by watching people figure
                  things out in real time and replicating it myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Victory Velocity is my attempt to get ahead of a shift I think is genuinely
                  significant. I could be wrong about the timeline. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
                  wrong about the direction.

                <p>
                  I&rsquo;m based in Vancouver, working at the intersection of machine learning
                  and full-stack engineering, and heading to UBC to study Computer Science & Business 
                  this fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Previously worked at an ML startup, I saw firsthand how fast the AI landscape
                  is changing the online browsing experience. What took months of SEO work to
                  rank is now getting rewritten by a language model in seconds — and most brands
                  have no idea it&rsquo;s happening.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Victory Velocity, I think the shift in how people find information is as
                  much a technical problem as a marketing one. I&rsquo;m here to build the
                  infrastructure that makes the strategy actually stick.
